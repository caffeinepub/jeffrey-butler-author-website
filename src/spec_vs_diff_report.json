  "summary": "Implemented a SafeImage component with onError fallback swapping and updated siteContent image paths; pages now use SafeImage for book covers and author portrait. Potential remaining risk: the updated author portrait path contains spaces and may still not resolve correctly in production depending on the actual filename under frontend/public and URL encoding/case.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "All image filenames referenced in code match the exact filenames present under frontend/public (including case sensitivity) and resolve to actual static files (no 404s), including the author portrait image.",
      "reason": "The diff updates the portrait path to a URL containing spaces (\"/assets/Jeffrey Butler profile image.png\"), which commonly causes production static-file resolution issues unless the underlying file path exactly matches and the server handles spaces/encoding as expected. The diff does not provide evidence that the referenced filename is web-safe or that a matching static file exists under frontend/public.",
