  "summary": "siteContent.ts was updated to reference new uploaded image paths for the Torment cover and author portrait, while keeping the second book cover on the existing placeholder. However, the diff shows no new static image assets added under frontend/public, so the uploaded image files themselves (with normalized filenames) do not appear to have been added.",

      "requirement": "Add the user-uploaded images to the frontend as static assets under frontend/public (e.g., /assets/uploads/) with normalized web-safe filenames (no spaces), and ensure Torment uses the uploaded cover and About uses the uploaded portrait with no broken image URLs.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows no added files, only modifications. While siteContent now references /assets/uploads/torment-cover.png and /assets/uploads/jeffrey-butler-portrait.png, there is no evidence that the actual image files were added under frontend/public/assets/uploads/, nor that the uploaded originals were saved with normalized filenames.",
